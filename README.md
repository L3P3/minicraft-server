# minicraft-server

This is my first rust project. After hearing that rust is too complicated for some people, I had to prove that I am better.

My extremely successful game [minicraft](https://github.com/L3P3/minicraft) is working offline. There is no way to share your world or to even play together with others.

This application will fix that!

## TODOs

- [x] create [minicraft](https://github.com/L3P3/minicraft)
- [x] read the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)
- [x] create a minimal http api
- [ ] handle user accounts
- [ ] receive and send worlds
- [ ] real time world serving
- [ ] web socket connections
- [ ] create rust videos

## API

It will be hosted at `https://l3p3.de/minicraft-api/`.

- `/greet/:name`: just for testing

## How to run

	cargo run

## Contribution

I am very glad to receive feedback of any kind!
